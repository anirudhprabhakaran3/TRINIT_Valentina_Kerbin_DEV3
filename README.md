# TRI NIT Hackathon - DEV03

This is the submission for the Tri-NIT hackathon from team Valentina Kerbin.

Team Members are:
- Anirudh Prabhakaran
- Dhruvil Lakhtaria
- Radhika Chhabra

## Note
Put your code in the respective directories. When you do, delete the `.keep` file. 

Also make a README telling how to run that part of the code, so that it is easier for me to make the docker-compose xD
